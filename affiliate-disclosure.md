# Affiliate Disclosure

**Last Updated: January 21, 2026**

## FTC Disclosure Statement

Roy Smart Collective ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to transparency in all our business relationships. This Affiliate Disclosure explains our financial relationships and how we may earn income through the content on royyolo.cloud (the "Site").

In compliance with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) guidelines, we disclose that we have financial relationships with some of the products and services mentioned on this Site.

## What Are Affiliate Links?

Affiliate links are special tracking links that allow us to earn a commission when you make a purchase through our recommendations. These links are provided to us by various companies and affiliate networks.

### How It Works:
1. You click on a product link on our Site
2. You are redirected to the merchant's website
3. If you make a purchase, we may receive a commission
4. **Important**: This does NOT increase your cost. You pay the same price as if you went directly to the merchant's site.

## Our Affiliate Relationships

We participate in several affiliate marketing programs, including but not limited to:

## Our Editorial Standards

### Independence and Honesty
Despite our affiliate relationships, we maintain complete editorial independence. Here's what this means:

**We Only Recommend What We Believe In:**
- We do not recommend products solely because they offer high commissions
- Our recommendations are based on product quality, value, and relevance
- We personally research and evaluate products before recommending them
- When possible, we test products ourselves or rely on credible sources

**Honest Reviews:**
- We highlight both strengths and weaknesses of products
- We provide balanced, objective information
- We disclose if we haven't personally tested a product
- We update reviews when products change or new information becomes available

**No False Claims:**
- We do not make exaggerated or misleading claims about products
- We do not promise specific results that cannot be guaranteed
- We encourage you to do your own research

## Types of Compensation

We may receive compensation in several ways:

### 1. Commission on Sales
When you purchase products through our affiliate links, we earn a percentage of the sale. Commission rates vary by:
- Product category (typically 1-50%)
- Merchant or affiliate program
- Specific product or service

### 2. Pay-Per-Click (PPC)
Some affiliate programs may pay us when you click on a link, regardless of whether you make a purchase.

### 3. Sponsored Content
Occasionally, we may publish sponsored content or reviews. When we do:
- We clearly mark the content as "Sponsored," "Paid Partnership," or similar
- We maintain editorial control over the content
- Sponsorship does not guarantee a positive review
- We only work with brands relevant to our audience

### 4. Free Products for Review
Sometimes, companies provide us with free products to review. When this occurs:
- We disclose when we've received a product for free
- Free products do not guarantee positive reviews
- We provide the same honest evaluation as purchased products

## Your Trust is Paramount

### Our Commitment to You:
1. **Transparency**: We will always disclose our affiliate relationships
2. **Honesty**: Our opinions remain our own, regardless of compensation
3. **Value**: We only recommend products we believe provide value

5. **Responsiveness**: We address your concerns and questions
